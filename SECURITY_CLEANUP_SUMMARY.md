# Security Cleanup Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

GitHub blocked your push because sensitive credentials were detected in your git history. This has now been completely resolved.

### Files Removed from Git History

The following sensitive files have been permanently removed from all git history:

1. **`server/.env`** - Contained:
   - Google OAuth Client ID and Secret
   - Database credentials
   - API keys
   - Email passwords

2. **`Myapp/android/app/google-services.json`** - Firebase Android configuration

3. **`Myapp/ios/Myapp/GoogleService-Info.plist`** - Firebase iOS configuration

4. **`Myapp/android/app/upload-keystore.jks`** - Android app signing key

5. **`Myapp/android/app/upload_cert.der`** - Android upload certificate

6. **Additional keystores:**
   - `myapp-signing.keystore`
   - `new-myapp.keystore`

### What Was Added

1. **Root `.gitignore`** - Prevents sensitive files from being committed:
   - `.env` files
   - Firebase config files
   - Signing keys and certificates
   - Log files

2. **Documentation:**
   - `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
   - `server/SETUP.md` - Server setup guide with environment variables
   - `Myapp/SETUP_MOBILE.md` - Mobile app setup with Firebase instructions
   - This summary document

## üéØ Current Status

- ‚úÖ All sensitive files removed from git history
- ‚úÖ .gitignore configured to prevent future commits
- ‚úÖ Successfully pushed to GitHub (Mobile branch)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive setup documentation created
- ‚úÖ No more GitHub push protection errors

## üìã What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Recreate Your Local `.env` File

```bash
cd server
cp env-setup.txt .env
# Edit .env and fill in your actual credentials
```

**Important:** This file will NOT be tracked by git (it's in .gitignore)

### 2. Get Firebase Configuration Files

#### For Android:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Your Apps ‚Üí Android app
4. Download `google-services.json`
5. Place it in: `Myapp/android/app/google-services.json`

#### For iOS:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Your Apps ‚Üí iOS app
4. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
5. Place it in: `Myapp/ios/Myapp/GoogleService-Info.plist`

### 3. For Production Builds

You'll need to regenerate or retrieve:
- Android signing keystores
- Upload certificates

**Never commit these to git!** Store them securely.

## üîí Security Best Practices Going Forward

### DO ‚úÖ
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Keep `.env` files local only
- Use `.env.example` or templates for documentation
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Use different credentials for dev/staging/production

### DON'T ‚ùå
- Never commit `.env` files
- Never commit Firebase config files
- Never commit signing keys or certificates
- Never share credentials in code or comments
- Never commit API keys or tokens

## üö® Important Note About Git History

The sensitive files have been removed from git history using `git filter-branch`. This rewrote the commit history on all branches.

**If other team members have cloned this repository:**

They need to re-clone or update their local copy:

```bash
# Option 1: Re-clone (safest)
cd ..
rm -rf App_Datlichkham
git clone https://github.com/ThinhTran02082004/WebAppDACN.git App_Datlichkham

# Option 2: Force update existing repo (careful!)
git fetch --all
git reset --hard WebAppDACN/Mobile
```

## üìû Need Help?

- Check `server/SETUP.md` for backend setup
- Check `Myapp/SETUP_MOBILE.md` for mobile setup
- Contact your team lead for Firebase access

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your repository is now secure and ready for development. The push to GitHub was successful and no secrets are exposed.
