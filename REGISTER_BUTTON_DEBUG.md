# Debug Register Button Issue

## Changes Made:

### 1. Added Console Logging
- Added console.log in handleRegister function
- Added console.log in onPress handler
- Added logging for user data and loading state

### 2. Improved Button Logic
- Button is disabled when loading OR when user hasn't agreed to terms
- Added visual feedback for disabled state
- Added proper styling for disabled text

### 3. Enhanced Validation
- Added NaN checks in date validation
- Added better error handling
- Added pre-submission date validation

## Debug Steps:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Open React Native debugger
   - Look for "Register button onPress triggered" when button is pressed
   - Check if handleRegister function is called

2. **Check Button State:**
   - Button should be disabled if user hasn't checked "agree to terms"
   - Button should show loading state when submitting

3. **Check Form Data:**
   - All required fields must be filled
   - Date of birth must be valid format (DD/MM/YYYY)
   - Passwords must match
   - Terms must be agreed to

## Common Issues:

1. **Button Disabled:** Check if user has agreed to terms
2. **Validation Fails:** Check date format and all required fields
3. **Network Error:** Check if server is running and API is accessible

## Test Cases:

### Valid Registration:
- Full Name: "Nguyễn Văn A"
- Date of Birth: "15/03/1990"
- Gender: "male"
- Email: "test@example.com"
- Phone: "0123456789"
- Password: "123456"
- Confirm Password: "123456"
- Agree to Terms: ✅

### Invalid Cases:
- Missing required fields
- Invalid date format
- Password mismatch
- Terms not agreed
